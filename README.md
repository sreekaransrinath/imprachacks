# Roll Ricks Not Joints

[Don't do drugs, kids] [All Contributions Welcome!]

### Project submission for MLH's [Impractical Hackers](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/6397-impractical-hackers) [Feb 5 - 7 2021] (Update - Won Most Impractical Hack!)

"What would you say, if I told you, there is an app on the market..." "WE'RE PAST THAT PART! JUST DEMO IT!"

Well, here's your demo!

### Inspiration
Don't do drugs, kids. We wanted to build something whimsical (a prank hack), keeping in mind the theme of this hackathon

### What it does
Roll Ricks, Not Joints is a simple extension which will randomly convert one in every five links on any webpage he/she happens to visit, and redirect it to the Never Gonna Give You Up YouTube video!

### How we built it
JavaScript, StackOverflow, and love

### Challenges we ran into
We kept accidentally Rick Rolling ourselves while testing the extension and Googling stuff, forgetting that we had the extension installed lmao

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working with tech we've never used before

### What we learned
Building chrome extensions

### What's next for Roll Ricks Not Joints
Vary the number of links per page that are converted so you can randomly rickroll people at maybe every 10th link

### Installation Instructions: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

It's super simple folks - 

- First, clone the extension onto your PC (or dowload zip and extract, pick your poison).

- Next, type in `chrome://extensions` in your (Chromium-based) browser's address bar, and you should see a `Developer Mode` toggle on the top right corner.

- Toggle that switch ON, and you'll see a button that says "Load Unpacked" pop up

- Now, click that button, and select the folder that you just cloned (or extracted), and it'll load the extension onto your browser. (It'll say `Video Speed Controller`, but that's just there to not arouse suspicion incase your friend notices the extension :P)

- And you're done! Refresh any webpages you might have had open so the extension can work its magic, and you've got yourself a wonderful chrome extension and an extremely confused friend xD

- P.S. Even if you hover over a link, it'll show it's original destination, since links are modified at a link-click level.
